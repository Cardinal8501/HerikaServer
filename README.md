# HerikaServer

New version of saig-gwserver. Also know as "Simple AI Gateway Skyrim Mod Gateway Server".

Part of the mod for Skyrim: Herika - The ChatGPT Companion. This component serves as a bridge between the SKSE plugin and various providers of text-to-voice, voice-to-text, and AI-based chat generators such as ChatGPT, koboldcpp, text-generation-webui, or openrouter.ai.

It also serves as the character's memory, employing various techniques to mitigate the lack of long-term memory in current LLMs (Language Model Models)

To run this you will only need a working Apache/PHP8.2 installation.
