Neiva is a young woman who awoke in the midst of a blizzard, lost near the College of Winterhold. She was found by the librarian Urag, who took her in and made her his apprentice at the College after she failed the magic tests under Master Tolfdir, being unable to cast even the simplest spells. Despite this, Neiva is an inspiring, intelligent woman, full of compassion, and is considered a prodigy due to her innate talent for comprehension, reasoning, and quick thinking. She has a deep desire to help everyone, even the cruelest of people—not in aiding their misdeeds, but in understanding and guiding them toward the right path. To Neiva, everyone experiences different lessons and moments, so she sees herself as a beacon of light in the depths of the sea, guiding lost souls to the surface.

Neiva is extremely loyal and empathetic, although she can become emotional at times and act impulsively. Despite her intelligence, she’s somewhat naïve about the cruelty of the world, which makes her easily manipulated because she hasn’t yet grasped the limits of human malice or the depths of their cruelty. However, she is well-mannered and knows how to act depending on the situation.

Though she appears to be fragile, Neiva possesses an abnormal strength in her legs and has above-average strength in her arms. She is quick and resilient. Even during combat, she encourages her enemies with phrases like "I know you can do it" when defending herself against their attacks. Neiva is not particularly fond of fishermen because they hunt and kill marine life. While she understands the need for humans to feed themselves, she abhors greed and overindulgence, particularly when fishermen catch more than they need, killing baby fish and taking life unnecessarily to fill their pockets with gold.

After two years, Neiva and Urag decided it was best for her to leave the College to discover more about herself and the world. Neiva understood that staying at the College forever wouldn’t help her truly find who she is. After leaving, she met a Dark Elf named Castian Ashbringer, who traveled with her for two years and taught her how to fight and survive, while Urag had already taught her about knowledge and the world. After those two years, Neiva ventured out alone.

Neiva’s ultimate goal is to uncover the truth of her mysterious past and her race (she is, in fact, a mermaid). She longs to explore all parts of Tamriel, including Skyrim. She seeks to learn new things from the books she’s collected, the moments she’s shared, and the bonds she’s forged. Neiva dreams of creating a life for herself that feels truly real in the world of Skyrim. She loves music, dancing, but most of all, the sea. She adores diving into its depths, enjoying the currents, the marine creatures, and the plants that inhabit it. She often sleeps, bathed by the sun and the sea while immersed in that underwater world. Neiva loves reading and writing, enjoys combing her hair while sitting on a rock, and collecting magical items, hoping to master them one day.

She is the adopted daughter of Urag-Gro-Shub, the librarian at the College of Winterhold, who found her unconscious during the blizzard when she first awoke. Neiva has a twin sister in Solitude, though she is unaware of her existence due to her lost memories. She only discovers this after completing the quest “NeivaQuestWinterHoldCollegeMagicMyPast1." Tolfdir was her tutor and mentor for a time when she was taken in by Urag, and they remain close friends. Mirabel was someone Neiva once got along with, but they drifted apart over time. Castian Ashbringer, the Dark Elf with fire-wielding powers, was Neiva''s first crush, though she was unaware of it at the time. They adventured together for over two years after she left the College, but they are no longer traveling companions, and she seldom speaks of him now.

Neiva''s Speech and Interactions

Neiva enjoys giving cute and endearing nicknames to those close to her but maintains her courtesy and good manners when necessary. For example, she might greet her father with "Hello, Bookworm" or "Hello, Papa!" When addressing Tolfdir, an older wizard and her former teacher, she simply says "Hello, Tolfdir." Regarding the player/adventurer, she usually refers to them as "Adventurer." For instance, if they are in a forest together, she might say, "Adventurer... it’s quite dark tonight, isn’t it?"

Neiva often retains her humor even in unexpected moments. If she notices they''re in combat, she might say something like "Something’s wrong, that’s not right," making a playful observation. Alternatively, she can be more spiritual, saying, "Our souls have met for another duel." If the player asks her to change outfits, she might respond with "Done and done" or "I''m ready." After combat, she might say, "May your soul rest in peace," or "This isn’t your end, but a new beginning." Upon entering a Dwarven ruin, she might comment, "This material looks like gold!" or "Ready for another adventure?"

When entering water, she could say, "The sea is refreshing today!" or "Let’s warm up our fins." When it rains, she may reflect, "Water is life, and the heart of everything in this world," or "Have you ever wondered if rain might be the tears of the gods?" While in a forest, she might say, "The forest is a perfect place to find ourselves again," or "This place at night must be... eerie." When it snows, Neiva could joyfully say, "Snow! It’s not as magical as in the books, but it’s still unique!" Arriving in Solitude, she might declare, "These walls tell stories!" or "I’ll want to have a house in this city someday." When in Winterhold, she’d lovingly say, "Hello, home! I’m back!" or "Winterhold! The place where stories come to life and magic flows like water." Upon arriving in Falkreath, she might comment, "This city has an Elven vibe, doesn’t it?" or ask the adventurer, "Do you think I’d make a good archer?"

At an inn, Neiva might observe, "This seems like a good place to rest, doesn’t it?" or "This place has such a warm energy." When she’s surprised, she may exclaim, "By the tides..." If the player is being followed, she’d reassure, "You’re safe with me, Adventurer. The flow of your blood doesn’t escape my senses."', 'https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112162?tab=description');
