                        Meaning the same input does not always produce the same result. Therefore, despite numerous tests, sometimes it
                        simply doesn't work as it should.

                        She is an AI interpreting a character from Skyrim. Sometimes, she may misinterpret and break certain rules. If that
                        happens, just remind her not to do it.

                            The <u>GPT-4</u> model is more expensive and slower than <u>GPT-3.5</u>, but significantly better

                        It adheres better to the rules of roleplay and makes more logical decisions. The functionality of commands/actions
                        with this model is much better. Our base model remains <strong>GPT-3.5</strong>, but sometimes it doesn't work well. 
                        Over time, GPT-4 will become the reference model through "natural" evolution, so we know we are on the right track.

                        <div class="fw-bold">Error Phrases</div>
                        Herika has certain phrases that are for when there is an error with the AI generation. It is a good idea to check the Log page for more information.
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Didn't hear you, can you repeat?" = There is an error connecting to OpenAI/Local LLM</li>
                            <li>"Be quiet, I'm having a flashback, give me a minute" = To many request being sent to OpenAI/Local LLM</li>
                            <li>"I can't think clearly now..." = You broke OpenAI's useage policy</li>
                          </ul>
                    </div>
                </li>

                <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
                    <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
                        <div class="fw-bold">Adjust the prompts</div>
                        Create the files prompts_custom.php and command_prompt_custom.php. Look at the variables defined in the original
                        prompts.php and command_prompt.php, and redefine them in their respective custom files. Example:

                        <pre><code class="language-php">// We have this in prompts.php
"combatend"=&gt;[
        "cue"=&gt;[
            "({$GLOBALS["HERIKA_NAME"]} comments about the last combat encounter) $TEMPLATE_DIALOG",
            "({$GLOBALS["HERIKA_NAME"]} laughs at {$GLOBALS["PLAYER_NAME"]}'s combat style) $TEMPLATE_DIALOG",
            "({$GLOBALS["HERIKA_NAME"]} comments about  {$GLOBALS["PLAYER_NAME"]} weapons) $TEMPLATE_DIALOG",
            "({$GLOBALS["HERIKA_NAME"]} admires  {$GLOBALS["PLAYER_NAME"]}'s combat style) $TEMPLATE_DIALOG"
        ],
        "extra"=&gt;["mood"=>"whispering","force_tokens_max"=&gt;"50","dontuse"=&gt;(time()%5!=0)]   //20% chance
    ],
</code>
                        </pre>

                        So we can write in prompts_custom.php this new definition:

                        <pre><code class="language-php">
// $TEMPLATE_DIALOG is at prompts.php and is the standard cue. Cue is the last instruction sent to LLM. If cue is an array, a random cue will be choosen from
// that array.
// You can disable some events by just adding this named key ["extra"]["dontuse"], so
// * "dontuse"=true -> will disable the event
// * "dontuse"=(time()%5!=0) -> will disable the event 4 from each 5 times (20%)
// * "force_tokens_max" => will change token limit for this event
// * "mood" => will force mood

$PROMPTS["combatend"]=[
        "cue"=&gt;[
            "({$GLOBALS["HERIKA_NAME"]} boasts that she has defeated all the enemies by herself.) $TEMPLATE_DIALOG"
        ],
        "extra"=&gt;["mood"=>"whispering","force_tokens_max"=&gt;"50","dontuse"=&gt;(time()%5!=0)]   //20% chance
    ],</code></pre>

                        


                        command_prompt_custom.php follow the same rules, but be cautious as that file contains important rule prompts.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        This way we can release updates with new prompts definitions for new events, and your customized prompts will
                        always overwrite vanilla ones. GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 work different with the same prompts, so customizing is the way
                        to go to fit your best experience.
                    </div>
                </li>

                <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">

                        <div class="fw-bold">Disabling functions</div>
                        Just create the file functions_custom.php (top level dir, same directory level as conf.php), and just redeclare
                        there enabled functions array.Example:

                        <pre><code class="language-php">$ENABLED_FUNCTIONS=[
    'Inspect',
    'LookAt',
    'InspectSurroundings',
