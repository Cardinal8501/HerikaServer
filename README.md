# AI Follower Framework Server

Server for the Skyrim mod "AI Follower Framework". This component serves as a bridge between the SKSE plugin and various providers of text-to-voice, voice-to-text, and AI-based chat generators such as ChatGPT, koboldcpp, Openrouter, XTTS, etc.

It also serves as the character's memory, employing various techniques to mitigate the lack of long-term memory in current LLMs (Language Model Models)
